ABOUT:\
This project is intended to prune unwanted chunks from Minecraft worlds.\
I will be using the excellent [substrate.dll](https://github.com/minecraft-dotnet/Substrate) created by **Justin Aquadro**.\
This program is currently in **Alpha** 9/28/2018

Proposed features:\
1. Anvil file format compatible, 1.2(?) - 1.12
2. Filter (erase) chunks based on Biome.
3. Filter (erase) chunks based on Block IDs ie. water, granite, crafting table, etc
4. Avoid at all costs writing to or damaging original files (readonly - Outputs map copies.)
